<h1>Bachelor Thesis: 6-axis robotic arm</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

The aim of this work was to design, construct and program robotic arm with six degrees of freedom. Each axis is driven by a stepper motor with adequate gear reduction on its shaft. End effector of this robot is a gripper powered by a servomotor. One can control this robot through a dedicated teach pendant which is connected to a microcontroller that processes its electric signals and sends appropriate commands to the stepper motor controllers. Additionally, a partial inverse kinematic algorithm has been implemented. Robot is working in an open-loop system, hence each axis is automatically calibrated using end switches.
